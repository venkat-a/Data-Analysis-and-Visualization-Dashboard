# Data Analysis and Visualization Dashboard
Development and deployment of a Plotly Dash dashboard on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and Heroku

## Project Overview

This project showcases a comprehensive approach to data cleaning, analysis, and visualization, deployed as an interactive dashboard using Plotly Dash. The core objective is to reveal insights through at least 20 different types of correlations, frequencies, and relationships between various variables in the dataset. This analysis is presented through meaningful plots and narrations, making extensive use of data cleaning techniques and visualization strategies.

## Modules

- **clean_data.py**: A module dedicated to preparing the dataset for analysis. This involves at least four steps of data cleaning to ensure the data is accurate and suitable for visualization.
- **visualization.py**: Handles the creation of visual representations of the dataset's underlying patterns and relationships. This module generates plots with clear titles, labels, and no overlapping, adhering to the project's visualization standards.
- **app.py**: Integrates the data cleaning and visualization modules into a Plotly Dash application. This serves as the entry point for the dashboard, orchestrating the data pipeline and user interface.

## Features

- **Interactive Data Visualizations**: Utilizes Plotly Dash to create interactive plots that allow users to explore various aspects of the dataset.
- **Comprehensive Data Cleaning**: Implements thorough preprocessing steps to ensure the data is of high quality for analysis.
- **Insightful Analysis**: Offers deep insights into the data through various types of correlations, frequencies, and relationships between variables.
- **Deployment**: The dashboard is deployed on both Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and Heroku, showcasing the flexibility and accessibility of the application.

## Deployment

The dashboard is accessible via URLs for both GCP and Heroku deployments. This ensures that users can interact with the dashboard from anywhere, without needing to run the code locally.
